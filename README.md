# ZhangScope
ZhangScope is an easy to replicate Oximeter with a substantial accuracy increase compared to the lower budgets one.

This is inspired by the current event of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the rise of interest in Oximeter products in the market, ZhangScope aims to offer a cheaper, but accurate platform to measure SpO2 concentration - together with a mobile application as a proof-of-concept.

<sub>_DISCLAIMER: This is part of an academic project, thus - it may not be perfect, but we hope that this repository and its content would at the very least provide a working example of an Arduino-based Pulse Oximeter with a complimentary mobile application._
  
This repository contains two codebases
  1. ZhangScope Oximeter (C++ / Arduino)
  2. ZhangScope Application Flutter (Dart)
